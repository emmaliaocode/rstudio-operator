## Kubernetes Environment
To develop the operator and in an isolated Kubernetes cluter, [install minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/?arch=%2Fmacos%2Farm64%2Fstable%2Fbinary+download). And start the minikube cluster with the following command.

```bash
minikube start
kubectl config current-context
kubectl get nodes
```

## Python Virtual Environment
Use any tool youâ€™re comfortable with to manage Python virtual environments and make sure the dependencies are installed.
```bash
pipenv shell --python 3.10.0
pipenv install -r requirements-dev.txt
```

## Run RStudio Operator locally
To test your Operator locally using `Kopf`, run:
```bash
kopf run src/handler.py
```
Kopf will watch your Kubernetes cluster and handle custom resources as defined.
